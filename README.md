Coderprep
=========

Originally created at DevFest 2012, Coderprep is the best way for coders to prep each other for interviews. Review common topics seen on coding interviews, track your progress on weak areas, and set up mock interviews with other coders.

Everything is built within the Ruby Sinatra framework and the website is currently hosted through heroku at www.coderprep.com
